These are the required libraries (third-party) to compile the code to the controllers. All credits are to the respective creators of each library.

* `ESP32Servo:` Library for controlling Servos with the ESP32 controller
* `HUSKYLENS:` Library to control the HuskyLens WebCam
* `MPU6050_tockn:` Library to control the Gyroscope-accelerometer MPU6050
* `NewPing:` Library to control HC-04 ultrasonic sensors
* `VL53L1X:` Library to control the Time Of Flight (IR laser) sensor
* `M5Stack:` Libraries to control the M5Stack controller with the arduino IDE. All related to installing it and uploading code to a M5Stack board could be found in --> https://docs.m5stack.com/en/quick_start/m5core/arduino
