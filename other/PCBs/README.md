This directory contains all the gerber files for the PCBs used in the car:

* `Frontal LEDs PCB`
* `Rear LEDs PCB`
* `Main PCB` - It has vias to connect extra pins to the microcontrollers if needed, but have to be soldered with external cables. It also has 3 cables as bridges (SS_A and bumper pins (not used)).
* `Encoders PCB` - Do not make the big holes for the encoders, those are an error of the program and are not supposed to be there.
